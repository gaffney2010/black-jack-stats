# Scope

This repo is designed to answer at least the following questions:

1.  Can a computer play black jack profitably WITHOUT adjusting bet size, if it keeps perfect track of cards?
2.  If so, is there a set of variables that can be easily tracked to play profitably?

I will also write this in Kotlin, because I'm trying to learn the language.

Because this may be a large project, I plan to have a few milestones:
1.  A black jack playing program.
2.  Add counters for each card remaining in the shoe (total distribution).
3.  Add strategy card and autoplay.
4.  Update strategy card and EV as we go.  Allow autoplay until strategy card changes.
5.  Build traditional high-low card count and display.

Then switch to a backend program.
5.  Simulate perfect strategy to see if long-term EV is positive.
6.  Build a training set with high-low card counts and associated distributions.  Use decision tree algorithm to decide rule-based strategy cards.  Compute long-term EV.
7.  Repeat with othe variables (counts).

We'll establish some black jack rules:
- Pays 3:2 on black jack
- Can double any hand
- Dealer hits on soft 17
- Can split any face cards
