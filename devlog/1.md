# Scope

This repo is designed to answer at least the following questions:

1.  Can a computer play black jack profitably WITHOUT adjusting bet size, if it keeps perfect track of cards?
2.  If so, is there a set of variables that can be easily tracked to play profitably?

I will also write this in Kotlin, because I'm trying to learn the language.

Because this may be a large project, I plan to have a few milestones:
1.  A black jack playing program.
2.  Add counters for each card remaining in the shoe (total distribution).
3.  Add strategy card and autoplay.
4.  Update strategy card and EV as we go.  Allow autoplay until strategy card changes.
5.  Build traditional high-low card count and display.

Then switch to a backend program.
5.  Simulate perfect strategy to see if long-term EV is positive.
6.  Build a training set with high-low card counts and associated distributions.  Use decision tree algorithm to decide rule-based strategy cards.  Compute long-term EV.
7.  Repeat with othe variables (counts).

We'll establish some black jack rules:
- Pays 3:2 on black jack
- Can double any hand
- Dealer hits on soft 17
- Can split any face cards

# Hello, world

It turns out that java applets haven't been used for about a decade, so I created a swing app, using ChatGPT for a Hello, World.

I created a Glyph pattern for drawing:

```kotlin
open class Glyph(val x: Int, val y: Int) {
    val children: MutableList<Glyph> = mutableListOf()

    fun addChild(child: Glyph) {
        children.add(child)
    }

    // Method to draw the glyph and its children
    fun draw(frame: JFrame, off_x: Int = 0, off_y: Int = 0) {
        draw_this(frame, off_x + x, off_y + y)
        for (child in children) {
            child.draw(frame, off_x + x, off_y + y)
        }
    }

    // Draw method for children with adjusted positions
    open fun draw_this(frame: JFrame, off_x: Int, off_y: Int) {}
}
```

This allows me to abstract components easily.  For example, I have a Card class with 20x20 cards, and I can make a Hand class like this:

```kotlin
class Hand(x: Int, y: Int) : Glyph(x, y) {
    fun addCard(char: String) {
        children.add(Card(25*children.size, 0, char))
    }
}
```
