## The dreaded split

I implemented splits as an afterthought, which was a mistake.  I ended up having to refactor most of the code as now I had to worry about multiple hands and multiple possible outcomes.

The nice part of the Controller class is that I can write this almost as pseudocode, acting as a project manager that the different components need to later figure out how to implement.

Before I start, I change hands from being DEALER and PLAYER to being 0 (dealer) and 1+ (player).

(Starting each Model function with "update" has become unsustainable.  I'm starting to get the hang of the Model-View-Controller pattern, so being explicit isn't as needed.)
