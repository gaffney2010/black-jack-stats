## Compute stats table

We're gonna use symjava and start a separate program to calculate expected values, which we'll roll up to the main program later.

We loop through all scenarios in reverse order (higher showing hands are first).  Scenarios are written as playershowing_dealershowing: S = {3_A, ..., 21_T, s12_A, ..., s21_T}, where the "s" indicates soft.

These will depend on:

- "pr_c" the probability of drawing card c
- "est_s" the expected value if you stand in scenario s
- "ehi_s" the expected value if you hit or stand (choosing the best option) in scenario s
- "edo_s" the EV if you can hit, stand, or double for scenario s
- "esp_s" the EV if you can split, hit, stand, or double for scenario s.  Set to -1 for odd hands and soft hands bigger than s12.

For example EV in scenario 18_6:

- EV if stand is "- pr_A * pr_2 - pr_A * pr_3 + ... + 2 * pr_T * pr_T + ..."
- EV if hit is "pr_A * ehi_19_6 + pr_2 * ehi_20_6 + pr_3 * ehi_21_6 - pr_4 - pr_5 - ... - pr_T".  Note that ehi_18_5 is the max of these first two options.
- EV if double is "2 * (pr_A * est_19_6 + pr_2 * est_20_6 + ... - pr_4 - ...)"
- EV if split is "2 * (pr_A * edo_s20_6 + pr_2 * edo_10_6 + ... + pr_8 * edo_17_6 + pr_10 * edo_19_6) / (1 - pr_9)"

Special care needs to be handled for A & T, where we assume there is not a black jack.  (Otherwise, no decision is needed.)

We'll precompute all of these as eqn_st, eqn_hi, eqn_do, and eqn_sp.  Then given a distribution or shoe, we follow the pseudo-code:

```
Compute vars = {pr_A, ..., pr_T}
For s in reversed(S):
    Compute {est, ehi, edo, esp} using eqn_st[s](vars), ..., eqn_sp[s](vars)
    Store these to vars
Translate to odds tables
```

I realized as I was working on this that I actually need to loop through scenarios kinda oddly:

1.  Loop through hard 12-hard 21
2.  Loop through soft 12-soft 21
3.  Loop through hard 3-hard 11

This will make sure that I'm always depending variables that have been set already.

## Compromises

I realized that the probabilities that I'm calculating assume replacement of the cards.  Fixing this would be too difficult, so I'll let this be.  For a full shoe, this does not result in _any_ decision being different; though there will be some edge cases where the decision is different for other distributions.

I chose the following rules, in addition to what I specified earlier:

- Allow hits on split aces (uncommon)
- Allow unlimited splits (uncommon, but rarely comes up)
- Don't allow doubles on splits (common) .
